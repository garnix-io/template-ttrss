# template-ttrss

A garnix-compatible repo for deploying your own [tiny-tiny-rss](https://tt-rss.org/) server.

To get your own ttrss going:

1) Create a [https://garnix.io](garnix) account if you don't have one yet.
2) Fork this repo.
3) Make sure the garnix GitHub App is enabled on this repo.
4) Change the lines marked [TODO](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agarnix-io%2Ftemplate-ttrss%20todo&type=code) to reflect your needs.
5) Push your changes! garnix will build and deploy the package, and make your
   server available in a `garnix.me` domain.
